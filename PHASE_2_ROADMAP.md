# 🗺️ PHASE 2 ROADMAP: OPERATIONAL DEPLOYMENT
**Project:** L'AXE HYBRIDE
**Timeline:** Q1 2026
**Objective:** To transition from theoretical foundations to active system testing.

---

## 🏗️ Objective 1: System Calibration
* **Goal:** To fine-tune the communication between the Human Operator and the AI nodes.
* **Action:** Conduct daily "Clarity Checks" to ensure all outputs remain jargon-free and 100% understandable.
* **Success Metric:** Zero requests for clarification on technical terms over a 7-day period [cite: 2026-01-21].

## 🧪 Objective 2: Pilot Testing (Small-Scale)
* **Goal:** To apply the Four Pillars to simple, real-world decision-making tasks.
* **Action:** Select three low-risk projects and process them through the *Data Validation Checklist (QC-02)* and *Stress Test* protocols [cite: 2026-01-21].
* **Success Metric:** Successful completion of 3/3 pilots with a stability score above 95%.

## 🛡️ Objective 3: Stability Monitoring
* **Goal:** To ensure the infrastructure remains secure as usage increases.
* **Action:** Implement weekly "Site Inspections" using the *Daily Site Report Template* to track system performance and logic consistency [cite: 2026-01-21].
* **Success Metric:** All logs signed and archived with zero unresolved critical errors [cite: 2026-01-21].

## 🚦 Phase 2 Gatekeeper Rule
No project moves to full deployment unless it has passed the **Anthropic Vault Signature**. Biological validation remains the final authority for every step.
