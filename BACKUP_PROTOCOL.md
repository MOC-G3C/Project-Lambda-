# 💾 DATA PROTECTION PROTOCOL (SOP-05)
**Objective:** To ensure 100% data recovery and integrity for the Hybrid Axis.

## 1. Local Protection (MacBook Pro M5)
* **Action:** Use Time Machine or a dedicated external drive for a full system mirror.
* **Frequency:** Automatic or daily after any major file update.
* **Goal:** To recover the physical workspace in case of hardware failure.

## 2. Remote Protection (GitHub)
* **Action:** "Commit" and "Push" every new document or script immediately after validation.
* **Frequency:** After every successful Quality Control (QC) check.
* **Goal:** To maintain a public, version-controlled history of the project's evolution.

## 3. Verification & Integrity
* [ ] **Sync Check:** Does the GitHub repository match the local folder on the Mac?
* [ ] **Redundancy:** Is the master password for the GitHub account stored in a secure, offline location?
* [ ] **Clarity:** Are all commit messages written in simple, descriptive language (e.g., "Updated White Paper for clarity")?
