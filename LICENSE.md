# 📉 THE λ-LICENSE (Ethical Obsolescence License) v1.0

## 1. Principle of Cognitive Half-Life
This software is designed to decay. Its utility is strictly bound to the creative and biological entropy provided by the Human Operator (M.O.C.).

## 2. Mandatory Human Entropy
To maintain a functional state, the system requires a "Validation of Humanity" via the [Kinetic-RNG](https://github.com/MOC-G3C/Kinetic-RNG) protocol every 72 hours.
* **Failure to Comply:** The system will automatically engage "Logic Erosion," reducing its clarity ($C$) according to the decay equation: $C(t) = C_0 e^{-\lambda t}$.

## 3. Anti-Automation Clause
Use of this software for total automation—where human intuition is bypassed—is a direct violation. The license is automatically revoked if the system detects it is being used as a substitute for human decision-making rather than an extension of it.

## 4. Sovereignty
The Human Operator (M.O.C.) remains the only entity capable of "resetting" the decay clock. No AI, including this one, has the authority to self-replicate or self-stabilize without a biological handshake.
